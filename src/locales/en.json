              "p1": "Trueway Corporation was born in 1980. Initially, the purpose of the business was for the founder, Mr. Hwang Yung Mao, to make enough money to buy a car for his family. At that time, one of his relatives was offering to sell him 4 antique knitting machines at a bargain price. He purchased them and started the business.",
              "p2": "Mr. Hwang soon understood that if you intend to make the grade, you not only need a good idea but you also need the right timing. When in the 1980's the business started to struggle, he looked for alternatives and started to develop industrial laminated fabrics, undeterred. At that time, most production techniques for laminated fabrics were from Japan and America. Taiwan did not yet have that kind of manufacturing ability. Nevertheless, Mr. Hwang jumped into this new market determinedly. He subsequently discovered that most laminated fabrics were used for water sport products, and has focused on these kind of fabrics to this day. As a good representation of its honesty and sincerity in everything it does –critical when dealing with an export market- the company was fittingly named “True Way.",
              "p3": "From the outset, Trueway focused on the manufacture of fabrics, and subsequently water sport fabrics. Today, with the increasing environmental issues and need for energy saving, Mr. Huang has begun integrating all these concerns into the development of the QUBICFIT range of clothing.",
              "p4": "Trueway was founded 30 years. During that time, Trueway has always tried to show its commitment to the improvement of our environment. Trueway's core values have always been intricately linked to environmental protection and esteem for people. Trueway not only meets the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certification standards, which means that Trueway's products do not make use of harmful substances. In addition, the company has also received bluesign＠certification which considers resource productivity, consumer safety, air emission, water emission and occupational health and safety together, in order to provide solutions concerning “Environment, Health and Safety” (EHS) on all levels.Reinvesting resources in ensuring that we are doing something meaningful towards the protection and preservation of our environment, as well as creating safe working conditions for our staff, is our pride. In a sense, it is Trueway's own real personal success story so far."
